> Traditional AI algorithms like Evolutionary Algorithms are currently receiving special attention from the research community thanks to the simplicity and effectiveness of these algorithms. In this first part of the Workshop we will review the fundamentals and some advanced topics about evolutionary algorithms.

Co-organized by **David Jiménez** *from the Multimodal Infomation Area* and **Diego Reiriz** and **Javier Guzman** from the *Intelligent Systems Area* @ Gradiant
